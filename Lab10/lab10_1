1. Would you rather use TensorFlow or Keras to build your models?

    I would rather use Keras to build my models since it is:
    i) user friendly - Keras follows best practices for reducing cognitive load via offering consistent and simple APIs and 
    minimizing the number of user actions. 
    ii) Modularity - Keras allows us to combine neural layers, cost functions, optimizers, initialization scheme, activation
    functions and regularization schemes to create new model.
    iii) Easy extensibility - it is easy to add new modules (as new classes and functions) which can make Keras suitable for 
    advanced research.
    Keras, in general, is a high-level neural networks API developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation and less
    detailed work required from the user side so I would rather use Keras over TensorFlow to build my models.
