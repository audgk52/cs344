Task 1: What does the confusion matrix show for this example?

  The confusion matrix for this example shows that predicted labels and true labels match up with accuracy above 0.8 (which is
  0.90 for this example).

Task 2: How does the TensorFlow network architecture differ from the Keras example given in class? Report any improvements you 
can make over the baseline testset accuracy for this task.

  
Task 3: What differences can you see between the visualizations for 10 steps and 1000 steps?
