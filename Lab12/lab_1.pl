Exercise 1.4 - Explain why you built the representations as you did.



Exercise 1.5 - Explain how Prolog comes up with its answers.
Consider the well-known modus ponens. Does Prolog implement a version of modus ponens in propositional logic form? If so, demonstrate how it’s done; if not, explain why not. If it doesn’t, can you implement one? Why or why not?

Prolog supports representations in the form of Horn clauses. Compare and contrast the representational power they provide with that of propositional logic.

Logical implementations generally distinguish the basic operations of TELL and ASK. Does Prolog support this distinction? If so, how; if not, why not?
