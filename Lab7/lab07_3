What is the purpose of introducing synthetic features?

      The purpose of introducing synthetic features is that combinations of features can provide better predictive abilities 
      beyond what those feautres can provide individually. Thus, for the example with california_housing_dataframe, we created
      a synthetic feature of rooms_per_person in addition to the existing features, total_rooms and population to figure out the 
      ratio in case one city block is more densely populated than another. 
      
What are outliers and what is typically done with them?

      When we create a scatter plot of preditions vs. target, outliers are the data points that are not fitted on a correlated
      diagonal line. Typically, clipping is done with outliers to improve the model fit by setting reasonable minimum or maximum
      values.
