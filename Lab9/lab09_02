a. Why are we regularizing with respect to sparsity?

We are regularizing with respect to sparsity because it can avoid over-fitting by sparsing which does leave out the zeros and 
remain non-zero components that are useful (reducing the model size). This makes the model more efficient in its computing. 
  
  
b. How does L1 regularization increase sparsity?

L1 regularization increases sparsity by encouraging weights to be exactly zero which allows to not use the corresponding feature
at all. 


c. Task 1: Here, just report the best log loss value / model size you can get and what gamma value you used to get them.
