a. How does the linear regression approach to the problem fare?

  The model will use labels with values in the set {0,1} and will try to predict a continuous value that is as close as
  possible to 0 or 1. Moreover, it is expected to interpret the output as a probability, so it would be ideal if the output
  will be within the range (0,1) with a threshold of 0.5 applied. 
  
b. Task 1: Compare and contrast L2 Loss vs LogLoss.
  
  L2 Loss, compared to LogLoss, does not penalize misclassifications with probability output. As it is mentioned in the lab
  instruction, it does not strongly differenciate the probabilities even with the difference between tenths place value and 
  ten-thousands place value. On the other hand, LogLoss does better job at penalizing miscalssifications,"confidence errors".
  
c. Task 2: Explain how the logistic regression fares compared to the linear regression.
  
  The logistic regression finds the probability output within the range (0,1) with a threshold of 0.5 applied while linear regression
  outputs RMSE which is a metric values. In terms of training and validation graph, compared to the linear regression, 
  the training and validation graphs of logistic regression go along closely which indicates better accuracy of training. 

d. Task 3: Here, just report the best values you can achieve for AUC/accuracy and what hyperparameters you used to get them.
