a. How does the linear regression approach to the problem fare?

  The model will use labels with values in the set {0,1} and will try to predict a continuous value that is as close as
  possible to 0 or 1. Moreover, it is expected to interpret the output as a probability, so it would be ideal if the output
  will be within the range (0,1) with a threshold of 0.5 applied. 
  
b. Task 1: Compare and contrast L2 Loss vs LogLoss.
  
  
  
c. Task 2: Explain how the logistic regression fares compared to the linear regression.
  
  

d. Task 3: Here, just report the best values you can achieve for AUC/accuracy and what hyperparameters you used to get them.
